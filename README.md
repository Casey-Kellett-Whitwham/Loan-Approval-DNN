# Loan-Approval-DNN
This project was completed in collaboration with [Evan Marinov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evan-marinov-1a2bab2b3/). <br><br>
It was the final project for the Luther College DS 420 class. <br><br>
The goal of the project was to explore multiple machine learning methods to predict if a requester would be approved for a loan based on the following variables:

- `person_age`
- `person_income`
- `person_home_ownership`
- `person_emp_length`
- `loan_intent`
- `loan_grade`
- `loan_amnt`
- `loan_int_rate`
- `loan_status`
- `loan_percent_income`
- `cb_person_default_on_files`
- `cb_person_cred_hist_length`
